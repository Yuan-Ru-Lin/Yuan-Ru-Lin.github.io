Forget about first impression.

Focus on zeroth impression.

<!--more-->

People come back to you when the first impression is good.

But only zeroth impression can bring the ones that came to you at the first place.

Start small. Build a blog. Run for a year.

The key is accumulation.

Don't worry about the audience, nor the feedback.

The best opportunity is always a surprise.
