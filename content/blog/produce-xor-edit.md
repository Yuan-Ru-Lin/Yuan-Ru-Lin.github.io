When you write, either produce content or modify what's been written.

## Implementation

1. Produce as early as possible:
    1. Start with bullet-points. List all things in your mind.
    2. Turn some of those into sentences.
    3. Fuse some of those sentences into paragraphs.
    4. Repeat, until you feel overwhelmed. Then go to (2).
2. Start editing:
    - Bold texts that you find important.
    - Delete texts that you find unnecessary.
    - Move texts to sort out logic.
    - Rewrite texts to say the same thing with simpler words or shorter sentences.
    - Repeat, until you find something missed in-between. Then go to (3).
3. Back to production:
    - Add bridge sentences between anything disconnected.
    - Extend what you've had.
    - Repeat, until you think it's time for editing. Then go back to (2).
4. Publish when you think it's [time to do so](https://yuan-ru-lin.github.io/blog/when-to-publish/).
