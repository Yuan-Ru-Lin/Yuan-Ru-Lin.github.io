RSS is an old-fashioned way to receive feeds from creators directly. It allows you to access information in a way that is

1. stable,
2. free of distraction and
3. untouched by algorithms.

Below are my feeds.

## My Curation

### For Taiwanese

I like commentaries or investigative journalism, so here are some of them. They are all free to subscribe, but the last two contain articles that require membership (which deserves the fee, I would say).

- 新頭殼的[觀點 - 評論](https://newtalk.tw/rss/opinion_news)
- [轉角國際 udn Global](https://global.udn.com/rss/lists/1020)
- [公視新聞](https://about.pts.org.tw/rss/XML/newsfeed.xml)
- [報導者](https://www.twreporter.org/a/rss2.xml)
- 上報的[調查](https://www.upmedia.mg/createRSS.php?Type=1)
- 風傳媒的[新新聞](http://storm.mg/feeds/24667)
- [端傳媒](https://theinitium.com/newsfeed/)

### For People Interested in Physics

[Phys.org](http://phys.org) popularises frontier researches with easy-to-read summaries and provides back-links to the related journal articles; [its feed on general physics](https://www.notion.so/Why-RSS-640ab92873194602a278cfce60f676ce), in particular, often gives out high-quality content.

[Symmetry](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/) focuses more on Particle Physics and often gives out soft content that serves as good reading.

## From other websites to RSS

Some blogs offer RSS buttons that you can subscribe its RSS by simply clicking them, but for others you need certain tricks.

### Medium

You can learn how to pipeline posts on Medium from [this article](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-Using-RSS-feeds-of-profiles-publications-and-topics).

### Blogs built with WordPress

While there are blogs that don't offer the forementioned button, some of them actually generate RSS feed automatically. The feed can be access by appending `/rss` (or `/feed`) to the url of the website. For example, *Humanity Island* (`https://humanityisland.nccu.edu.tw`) doesn't have the button in the page, but you still can access the feed from  `https://humanityisland.nccu.edu.tw/feed`. [2]
