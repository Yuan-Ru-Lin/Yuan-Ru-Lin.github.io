title: On Note-Taking Softwares

summary: Markdown and all that.
---

A junior of mine once asked whether I take notes when doing researches, to which I replied 

> "Of course I do, and you will have to, if you want to keep your sanity."

I followed up the answer with some remarks, which other juniors find interesting, hence this article.

First, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a good thing to learn. It's simple and is supported by many editors, one of which surely will suit you.

Just to name a few, there are

* Ulysses for those who likes to set goals and customise stuff,
* Bear for those who hates Evernote but wants something similar,
* Obsidian for those who wants to use Bear but refuses to pay for an app every month, and finally
* iA Writer for those who prefers one-time payment[^footnote].

[^footnote]: Myself included.

## On Notion

I've noticed some people start taking notes in Notion, which I had tried for several months before giving up. I mean, the blocks were cool and all, but at the end of day, I just want to flush out my thoughts and assign some simple structure to them. No need for _**blocks within blocks within another giant block!**_

## Quick-and-Dirty Example for Markdown Syntax

You may just look at the source code of this article.[^more-features][^compile]

[^more-features]: You can also add images and tables; I rarely do that, though.

[^compile]: If you want to convert your `.md` files into PDF, [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) is the way to go.
